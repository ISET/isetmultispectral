% DeriveBasisAndCoefficients.m
%
% Derive the coefficients from a multispectral capture.  The original data
% are a matrix with, say, 6 color channels based on the D100 with a clear
% image and with a red filter.  We compute color signal basis functions (up to 6).
% We then use the camera data to estimate the values of the basis
% coefficients.  The coefficients and basis functions are stored in a file
% that can be called by vCamera and other programs so that we have
% estimated color signals.
